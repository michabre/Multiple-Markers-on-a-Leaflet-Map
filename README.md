# Multiple Markers on a LeafletJS Map

A simple example of a Leaflet map with multiple markers using HTML, CSS, and JS.

In the example, I am using Food Trucks based in Victoria, BC courtesy of the [Street Food App](https://streetfoodapp.com/)


## Getting Started

Upload this code to a local, public or private web server that supports HTML, JS and CSS. 

I use Live Server with Visual Studio Code to run simple static code, but you can use MAMP, XAMPP, NodeJS, IIS, - really whatever you like and prefer.


## Built With

* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editing. Redefined.
